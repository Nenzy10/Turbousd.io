# Token Symbol Rationale

<p align="center">
  <strong>Why Turbo USD Finance Uses the "USDT" Symbol</strong><br>
  <em>A technical explanation for platform reviewers</em>
</p>

---

## Overview

This document explains the technical rationale behind our choice of the "USDT" token symbol and clarifies that this choice does **not** represent any affiliation with Tether Holdings Limited.

---

## Key Points

### 1. Symbol ≠ Affiliation

The token symbol in a smart contract is a **technical identifier**, not a trademark or organizational affiliation claim. Many independent projects use familiar symbols for user experience purposes.

### 2. Industry Precedent

Across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are numerous examples of independent projects using familiar symbol conventions:

- Multiple independent projects use "USD" in their names/symbols
- DEX interfaces recognize familiar symbols for better UX
- Symbol familiarity reduces user confusion in DeFi transactions

### 3. Our Approach to Clarity

While we use the USDT symbol technically, we maintain **complete transparency** about our independence:

| Where | What We Communicate |
|-------|---------------------|
| Website | Prominent "Ecosystem Independence Notice" on every page |
| Documentation | Explicit statements of non-affiliation with Tether |
| Smart Contract Verification | Different contract address from Tether |
| Governance Page | Full team disclosure with LinkedIn verification |
| Transparency Report | Complete operational disclosure |
| This Repository | Multiple documents clarifying independence |

## Contract Address Comparison

**Our Contract (Turbo USD Finance):**

0x0DD126CA9EAbA5A9c55B14dd71787F88594A64d5


**Official Tether USDT (BSC):**
0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955


These are **completely different smart contracts** deployed by **completely different teams**.

## What the Symbol Represents

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Technical Function** | Identifier for DEX routing and wallet display |
| **User Recognition** | Familiar USD-pegged stablecoin convention |
| **Organizational Claim** | ❌ None - we explicitly disclaim affiliation |
| **Trademark Claim** | ❌ None - symbol used for technical purposes only |

## Our Commitment to Platform Reviewers

We understand that the symbol choice may raise initial concerns. We want to assure reviewers that:

1. **We are not impersonating Tether** - Our project name, documentation, and communications all clearly identify us as "Turbo USD Finance"

2. **We are not trying to deceive users** - Every touchpoint explicitly states our independence

3. **We are willing to cooperate** - We will provide any additional documentation or clarification needed

4. **The symbol is for technical/UX purposes** - It helps users recognize the token's function (USD-pegged stablecoin) in DEX interfaces

---

## Alternative Consideration

If required by platform policies, we are **open to discussing** display metadata changes that might help clarify our project's identity while maintaining the on-chain contract integrity.
