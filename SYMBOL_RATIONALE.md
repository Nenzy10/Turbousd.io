# Token Symbol Rationale

<p align="center">
  <strong>Why Turbo USD Finance Uses the "USDT" Symbol</strong><br>
  <em>A technical explanation for platform reviewers</em>
</p>

---

## Overview

This document explains the technical rationale behind our choice of the "USDT" token symbol and clarifies that this choice does **not** represent any affiliation with Tether Holdings Limited.

## Key Points

### 1. Symbol ≠ Affiliation

The token symbol in a smart contract is a **technical identifier**, not a trademark or organizational affiliation claim. Many independent projects use familiar symbols for user experience purposes.

### 2. Industry Precedent

Across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are numerous examples of independent projects using familiar symbol conventions:

- Multiple independent projects use "USD" in their names/symbols
- DEX interfaces recognize familiar symbols for better UX
- Symbol familiarity reduces user confusion in DeFi transactions

### 3. Our Approach to Clarity

While we use the USDT symbol technically, we maintain **complete transparency** about our independence:

| Where | What We Communicate |
|-------|---------------------|
| Website | Prominent "Ecosystem Independence Notice" on every page |
| Documentation | Explicit statements of non-affiliation with Tether |
| Smart Contract Verification | Different contract address from Tether |
