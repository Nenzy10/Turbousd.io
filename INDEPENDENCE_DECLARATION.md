## Why the "USDT" Symbol?

The "USDT" symbol in our smart contract is a **technical identifier only** and does not represent any trademark claim, affiliation, or endorsement.

### 1. DeFi Familiarity
The USDT symbol is universally recognized for USD-pegged stablecoins, reducing user confusion in DeFi interfaces.

### 2. Technical Standard
Many independent stablecoins use familiar symbols for interoperability. The symbol does not imply organizational affiliation.

### 3. User Experience
Users expect stablecoins to use recognizable symbols. Our independent branding is communicated through our project name and documentation.

### 4. Ecosystem Clarity
Within the Turbo USD Finance ecosystem, the token is clearly identified as our native stablecoin, separate from any third-party tokens.
